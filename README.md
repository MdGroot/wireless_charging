## STM programming
# STM programming goals
- [ ] Research ADC operation
- [ ] Research DMA operation
- [ ] Research PWM operation
- [ ] Identify pins and timers needed for different operations
- [ ] Create complemantary PWM signals with deadtime
- [ ] Create variable frequency PWM signals **if needed**

## Simulation
# Simulation goals
- [x] Make a basic MMPT model
- [ ] Get realistic timing in the model
- [ ] Model the DCDC converter
- [ ] Model the DCAC converter with coil
- [ ] Integrate the different models into 1
- [ ] Improve the generator model
- [ ] Expand the MMPT algorithm
